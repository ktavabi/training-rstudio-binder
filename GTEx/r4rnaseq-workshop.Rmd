## Introduction 

The book [“R for Data Science”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) provides an excellent framework for using data science to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We will use this framework as an outline for this workshop.

**R** is a statistical computing and data visualization programming language. **RStudio** is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. R and RStudio work on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems. The RStudio layout displays lots of useful information and allows us to run R code from a script and view and save outputs all from one interface.

When you start RStudio, you’ll see two key regions in the interface: the console and the output. When working in R, you can type directly into the console, or you can type into a script. Saving commands in a script will make it easier to reproduce. You will learn more as we go along!

For today's lesson, we will focus on data from the [Gene Expression Tissue (GTEx) Project](https://commonfund.nih.gov/gtex). The GTEx is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. 

By the end of today’s workshop, you create tables and plots like the
ones below that give an overview of the samples collected
and the variables that can be used for differential gene expression
analysis. More importantly, you will learn the basics of importing, tidying, transforming, and visualizing data, which are the key component of an R workflow. 

### Some motivating questions

* How many RNA-sequencing samples are in the GTEx project? 
* What is the age and sex of each donor?
* What was the cause of death?
* What is the effect of age on gene expression in the heart?
* Do you have enough samples to test the effects of sex, age, hardy scale, and their interactions for all tissues? 
* How do I combine, clean, modify, separate, etc. data sets and variables?
* How is my gene of interest affected by age in the heart and brain?

### Getting Started

1. Click the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nih-cfde/training-rstudio-binder/data?urlpath=rstudio) button to generate a computing environment for this workshop.
2. Navigate to the GTEX folder.
3. Click `GTEx.Rproj` and click "Yes" to open up an Rproject. This will set the working directory to `~/GTEx/`.
4. Open the `r4rnaseq-workshop.R` file which contains all the commands for today's workshop. This contains all the commands we will build today. This is your reference.
5. Open a new R Script by clicking **File > New File > R Script**. You will type most commands for today's lesson here and click "Run" to send them to the console. 


### R packages

[**Tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages that include functions, data, and documentation that provide more tools and capabilities when using R. There are many packages for R, but we are using this set because the packages are designed to work well together -and they are especially useful (and popular!) for doing data science. 

You can install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code: `install.packages("tidyverse")`, or you can install packages individually (e.g. `install.packages("ggplot2")`). It is a good idea to "comment out" this line of code by adding a `#` at the beginning so that you don't re-install the package every time you run the script. For this workshop, the packages listed in the `.binder/environment.yml` file were pre-installed with Conda. For some reason, the tidyverse package doesn't always install properly, so we installed each package individually.

```{r  eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("tidyr")
```

After installing packages, we need to load the functions and tools we want to use from the package with the `library()` command. Let's load the following packages: `ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, readr, and tibble` by copying and pasting or typing these commands into your new script.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)
```

```{r, otherpackages, echo = F, message = F, warning=F }
library(cowplot)
library(scales)
library(forcats)
library(stringr)
```


```{asis, comment = ""}

:::warning

#### Challenge

We will also use `cowplot` and  `scales` to make pretty visualizations, `forcats.` for working with factors, and `stringr` for parsing text. What commands do you need to add to your script to load these packages?

:::spoiler 

  `library(cowplot)`  
  `library(scales)`  
  `library(forcats)`  
  `library(stringr)`  
:::

```


[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) is an open-source software project developed for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology. The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration, and rapid development of scientific software. It is based on the statistical programming language R. We will not be using these packages in this class, but they are worth getting to know. This is how you would install and load 3 different Bioconductor packages. 

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=F}

#if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install()

#BiocManager::install(c("recount3", "biomaRt", "DESeq2"))

#library(recount3)
#library(biomaRt)
#library(DESeq2)
```


You can also navigate to "Packages" Tab in the bottom right pane of RStudio to view a list of available packages. Packages with a checked box next to them have been successfully loaded. You can click a box to load installed packages. Clicking the "Help" Tab will provide a quick description of the package and its functions.

#### Key functions

| `library()` | The command used to load installed packages |
:::

```


## Import

Data can be imported using packages from base R or the tidyverse.  

What are some differences between the data objects imported by `read.csv()` and `read_csv()`?

1. Periods versus spaces in column names
2. Data frame versus tibble
3. Row names allowed versus not allowed.

The `GTExPortal.csv` file in `./data/` contains information about all the samples in the GTEx portal. Let's import this file using `read.csv()`. Then use `head()` to view the first few lines of each file. 

```{r import-1}
samples <- read.csv("./data/GTExPortal.csv")
head(samples)
```

Very large tabular files are often saved as .tsv files. These can be imported with `read.table()` or  `read_tsv()`. You can also specify the tab delimiter as well as the row and column names.

```{r import-2}

results <- read.table("./data/GTEx_Heart_20-29_vs_30-39.tsv")
head(results)

results2 <- read.table("./data/GTEx_Heart_20-29_vs_30-39.tsv", 
                      sep = "\t", header = TRUE )
head(results2)
```

I find it helpful to import a table of gene names and symbols that can be merged with other tables with gene information or searched for useful information. This table of gene names was downloaded from <https://www.genenames.org/download/custom/>. 

In this case, we use `fill = T` to fill missing fields with a NULL value.

```{r import-3}
genes <- read.table("./data/genes.txt", sep = "\t", 
                    header = T, fill = T)
head(genes)
dim(genes)
```


```{asis, comment = ""}

:::info Using the Terminal to uncompress files

Very large data files, such as files with RNA-Seq counts are often compressed before they are shared. To uncompress a file, click on the Terminal tab and run the following command.

  gunzip -k ./data/countData.HEART.csv.gz

:::

```

```{bash, echo = F}
rm ./data/countData.HEART.csv
gunzip -k ./data/countData.HEART.csv.gz
```



Once that file is uncompressed, it can be imported. Count files can be very long and wide, so it is a good idea to only view the first (or last) few rows and columns. Typically, a gene identifier (like an ensemble id) will be used as the row names. We can use `dim` to see how many rows and columns are in the file. 




```{r import-4}
counts <- read.csv("./data/countData.HEART.csv", 
                   header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
dim(counts)
head(counts)[1:5]
```

To process the counts data using the DESEq2 pipeline, we need a corresponding file where the row names are the sample id and they match the column names of the counts file. We confirm this by asking if `rownames(colData) == colnames(counts)` or by checking the dimensions of each. 

Using  `head()` is a good way to only print 5 rows. Using `[1:5]` is a good way to only print 5 columns.


```{r import-5}
colData <- read.csv("./data/colData.HEART.csv", 
                    header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
head(colData)[1:5]
head(rownames(colData) == colnames(counts))
```





```{asis, comment = ""}

:::warning

#### Challenge

What command would you use to read the GTEx results comparing the brains of 20-29 year old to 70-79 year olds?

:::spoiler

There any multiple solutions to this  question. One solution is:

  `read.table("./data/GTEx_Brain_20-29_vs_70-79.tsv")`  
:::

```

You have now seen a variety of options for importing files. You may use many more in your R-based RNA-seq workflow, but these basics will get you started.

| `dim()`  | A function that prints the dimensions of an object | 
| `as_tibble()` | Convert dataframes to tibbles | 
:::

```

## Tidy and Transform

Let's look at the structure of our data frames. The `str()` and  `summary()` commands quickly summarize every variable in a data frame. 

```{r}
str(samples)
summary(samples)
str(results2)
summary(results2)
str(genes)
summary(genes)
summary(counts[1:5])
```



The defult classification for each variable may or may not be appropriate for you analysis. In this section, we will discuss all the ways to tidy and transform your data.



### Renameing variables to join data frames

In the next section, we will join two data frames by a shared column. Both the results file and the genes file have a column with gene symbols, but they do not have the same name. 


We can use the `rename` function to rename columns. The first value is the new name and the second value is the old name. Just in case we get it wrong, let's save this as a new object.

```{r rename}
head(results2)
head(genes)

head(results2$X)
head(genes$Approved.symbol)

results_new <- results2 %>%
  dplyr::rename("Approved.symbol" = "X")
head(results_new)
```

Now that the results and the genes objects both have a column called `Approved.symbol` they can be joined. The command `full_join()` will keep all rows of both objects. `left_join` will keep all the rows in the first object but will drop any rows in the second object that don't map onto the first. 

```{r join}
results_genes <- left_join(results_new, genes, by = "Approved.symbol")
head(results_genes)
```


```{r mutate}
head(counts)[1:5]
head(genes$Ensembl.gene.ID)

genes2 <- genes %>%
  mutate(Ensembl.gene.ID = paste(Ensembl.gene.ID, "1", sep = "."))

counts2 <- counts %>%
  mutate(Ensembl.gene.ID = row.names(.))

head(counts2$Ensembl.gene.ID)[1:5]
head(genes2$Ensembl.gene.ID)
```


Most RNA-Seq pipelines require that the counts be in a “wide” format where each sample is a column and each gene is a row. However, many R tools prefer data in the long format. I like to create a counts_long file that can be easily subset by variables or genes of interest.

For this, we must introduce the pipe, `%>%`. This symbol is used to redirect the output from standard out to another function. 



```{r}

counts_long <- counts2 %>%
  pivot_longer(-Ensembl.gene.ID, names_to = "Tissue.Sample.ID", values_to = "counts") %>%
  inner_join(., genes2, by = "Ensembl.gene.ID") %>%
  arrange(desc(counts))
head(counts_long)


head(samples)
head(samples$Tissue.Sample.ID)
head(counts_long$Tissue.Sample.ID)
```

Yea, we have joined some data frames. Now let's do a little more cleaning and joining. 

```{r}
head(counts_long$Tissue.Sample.ID)
head(samples$Tissue.Sample.ID)

counts_long_newname <- counts_long %>%
  separate(Tissue.Sample.ID, into = c("Tissue.Sample.ID", NULL), 
           sep =  "_SM_")

head(counts_long_newname$Tissue.Sample.ID)
head(samples$Tissue.Sample.ID)

samples_new <- samples %>%
  mutate(Tissue.Sample.ID = gsub("-", "_", Tissue.Sample.ID))
head(samples$Tissue.Sample.ID)


counts_long_samples <- counts_long_newname %>%
  inner_join(., samples_new, by = "Tissue.Sample.ID")
head(counts_long_samples)

```

Now you have a file with the counts every gene as well as the experimental variables in 1 data frame.
