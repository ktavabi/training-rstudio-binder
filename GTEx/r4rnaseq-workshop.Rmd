<!---

_Even though you can [![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/2ArmQGwGT0uUyL5Ehqy0hQ/badge)](https://hackmd.io/2ArmQGwGT0uUyL5Ehqy0hQ), please make changes by editing [this .Rmd file](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-rstudio-binder/blob/data/GTEx/r4rnaseq-workshop.Rmd)._

--->

**When:** Wednesday,  April 27, 2022, 10 am - 12 pm PDT [workd clock](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=+Introduction+to+R+for+RNA-Sequencing+Analysis&iso=20220427T10&p1=3736&ah=2)   
**Where:** [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/7575820324?pwd=d2UyMEhYZGNiV3kyUFpUL1EwQmthQT09) and [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nih-cfde/training-rstudio-binder/data?urlpath=rstudio)  
**Instructors:** Dr. Rayna Harris  
**Organizer:** [The Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://training.nih-cfde.org/)

**Description:** RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a popular method for determining the presence and quantity of RNA in biological samples. In this 2 hour workshop, we will use R to explore publicly-available RNA-Seq data from the [Gene Expression Tissue Project (GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/). Attendees will be introduced to the R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures common to RNA-Seq projects. We will use RStudio to import, tidy, transform, and visualize RNA-Seq count data. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for making the processes of data wrangling and data harmonization more manageable. This workshop will not cover cloud-based workflows for processing RNA-seq reads or statistics and modeling because these topics are covered in our [RNA-Seq Concepts](https://osf.io/kj5av/) and [RNA-Seq in the Cloud](https://github.com/nih-cfde/rnaseq-in-the-cloud/blob/stable/rnaseq-workflow.pdf) workshops. Rather, this workshop will focus on general R concepts applied to RNA-Seq data. Familiarity with R is not required but would be useful.

## Introduction 

The book [“R for Data Science”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) provides an excellent framework for using data science to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We will use this framework as an outline for this workshop.

**R** is a statistical computing and data visualization programming language. **RStudio** is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. R and RStudio work on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems. The RStudio layout displays lots of useful information and allows us to run R code from a script and view and save outputs all from one interface.

When you start RStudio, you’ll see two key regions in the interface: the console and the output. When working in R, you can type directly into the console, or you can type into a script. Saving commands in a script will make it easier to reproduce. You will learn more as we go along! 


![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1a8-HHx5.png)

For today's lesson, we will focus on data from the [Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project](https://commonfund.nih.gov/gtex). GTEx is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq.

### Getting Started

1. Click the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nih-cfde/training-rstudio-binder/data?urlpath=rstudio) button to generate a computing environment for this workshop.
2. Navigate to the GTEx folder.
3. Click `GTEx.Rproj` and click "Yes" to open up an Rproject. This will set the working directory to `~/GTEx/`.
4. Open the `r4rnaseq-workshop.R` file which contains all the commands for today's workshop. This contains all the commands we will build today. This is your reference.
5. Open a new R Script by clicking **File > New File > R Script**. You will type most commands for today's lesson here and click "Run" to send them to the console. 


### Loading R packages

Many of the functions we will use are pre-installed. The [**Tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages that include functions, data, and documentation that provide more tools and capabilities when using R. You can install packages like `ggplot2` with the command  `install.packages("ggplot2")`). It is a good idea to "comment out" this line of code by adding a `#` at the beginning so that you don't re-install the package every time you run the script. For this workshop, the packages listed in the `.binder/environment.yml` file were pre-installed with Conda. For some reason, the tidyverse package doesn't always install properly, so we installed each package individually.

```{r  eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
```

After installing packages, we need to load the functions and tools we want to use from the package with the `library()` command. Let's load the `ggplot2` package which is a popular tool for data visualization.

```{r, message=FALSE, appendix = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
```



<div class="warning">

#### Challenge

We will also use functions from the packages `tidyr` and  `dplyr` to tidy and transform data. What command would you run to load these packages?

<div class="spoiler">

  `library(tidyr)`  
  `library(dplyr)`  
 
</div>


```{r, otherpackages, echo = F, message = F, warning=F , appendix = TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

You can also navigate to the "Packages" tab in the bottom right pane of RStudio to view a list of available packages. Packages with a checked box next to them have been successfully loaded. You can click a box to load installed packages. Clicking the "Help" Tab will provide a quick description of the package and its functions.


<div class="success">

#### Key functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `install.packages()` | An R function to install packages |
| `library()` | The command used to load installed packages |

</div>


## Importing and viewing data

Data can be imported using packages from base R or the tidyverse. What are some differences between the data objects imported by base R functions such as `read.csv()` and Tidyverse functions such as `read_csv()`? To begin with, `read.csv()` replaces spaces and dashes periods in column names, and it also preserves row.names. On the other hand, `read_csv()` preserves spaces and dashes in column names but drops row.names. For this workshop, we will use `read_csv()`, which means we may have to replace dashes with periods so that our sample names in all objects with sample name information.

Today, I will show you how to import the following files:

1. data/samples.csv
1. data/GTExHeart_20-29_vs_70-79.tsv
1. data/colData.HEART.csv
1. data/countData.HEART.csv.gz


Then, you will practice on your own using the following files:

1. data/GTExMuscle_20-29_vs_70-79.tsv
1. data/colData.MUSCLE.csv
1. data/countData.MUSCLE.csv.gz


The `GTExPortal.csv` file in `./data/` contains information about all the samples in the GTEx portal. Let's import this file using `read.csv()`. 

```{r import-1, appendix = TRUE}

samples <- read.csv("./data/samples.csv")

```
After importing a file, there are multiple ways to view the data. `head()` to view the first few lines of each file. `names()` will print just the column names. `str` will compactly displaying the internal structure. `summary` will compute statistics.

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

head(samples)
names(samples)
str(samples)
summary(samples)
```




Count files can be very long and wide, so it is a good idea to only view the first (or last) few rows and columns. Typically, a gene identifier (like an ensemble id) will be used as the row names. We can use `dim` to see how many rows and columns are in the file. 


```{r import-4, appendix = TRUE}

counts <- read.csv("./data/countData.HEART.csv", 
                   header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
dim(counts)
head(counts)[1:5]

```

This "countData" was generated by using `recount3` as described in the file `scripts/recount3.Rmd`. It comes from a Ranged Summarized Experiment (rse) which contains quantitative information about read counts as well as quality control information and sample descriptions. The "colData" from an rse can also be obtained. This information _should_ match the information in our samples file, but there can be subtle differences in formatting Let's read the colData file for the heart samples. 



```{r import-5, appendix = TRUE}

colData <- read.csv("./data/colData.HEART.csv", row.names = 1)
head(colData)

```


Very large tabular files are often saved as .tsv files. These can be imported with `read.table()` or  `read_tsv()`. You can also specify the tab delimiter as well as the row and column names. You can import files using the default parameters or you can change them. Because the first column in the .tsv files does not have a row name, by default, `read.table()`, imports the first column as the row.names. When `sep = "\t", header = TRUE` is specified, the fist column is imported as column one and given the column name  `X`.

```{r import-2, appendix = TRUE}

# with row.names
results <- read.table("./data/GTEx_Heart_20-29_vs_30-39.tsv")
head(results)

# without row.names
results2 <- read.table("./data/GTEx_Heart_20-29_vs_30-39.tsv",  sep = "\t", header = TRUE )
head(results2)

```

<div class="warning">

#### Challenge

What commands could you use to read the following files:
1. GTEx results comparing the muscles of 20-29 year old to 70-79 year olds?
1. The csv file information describing the muscle samples? 


<div class="spoiler">

1. `read.table("./data/GTEx_Muscle_20-29_vs_70-79.tsv")` 
1. `read.csv("./data/colData.MUSCLE.csv")`  

</div>


#### Quick summary statistics and sample size

You have now seen a variety of options for importing files. You may use many more in your R-based RNA-seq workflow, but these basics will get you started. Let's now explore the functions `summary()`,  `length()`, `dim()`, and `count()` us to quickly summarize and compare data frames to answer the following questions.




How many transcripts were counted in the Heart tissues?  Over 63,000.

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

dim(counts)
length(row.names(counts))

```

How many samples do we have? Over 1400!

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

dim(samples)
length(samples$SMTS)

```

How many samples are there per tissue? 

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

dplyr::count(samples, SMTS) 

```

How many samples are there per tissue and sex? Can we test the effect of sex on gene expression in all tissues? For many samples, yes, but not all tissues were samples from both males and females. 

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

dplyr::count(samples, SMTS, SEX) 

```

How many samples are there per sex, age, and hardy scale in the HEART tissues? Do you have enough samples to test the effects of Sex, Age, and Hardy Scale in the Heart? 

_Note: Let's use the colData data frame for this since it is specific to Heart. Later we will talk about sub-setting._

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

#names(colData)
dplyr::count(colData, SMTS, SEX, AGE, DTHHRDY ) 

```


<div class="warning">

#### Challenge

What series commands would you use to import the `data/colData.MUSCLE.csv` and count the number of muscles samples per sex, age? 

How many female muscles samples are there from age group 30-39?

_Hint: use head() or names() after importing a file to verify the variable names._


<div class="spoiler">

  df <- read.csv("./data/colData.MUSCLE.csv") 
  dplyr::count(df, SMTS, SEX, AGE)
  # 3 samples are in the female group age 30-39
  
</div>



Finally, the `str()` and  `summary()` commands are also quite useful for summarizing every variable in a data frame. These let you know if R has imported columns properly as integers, characters or factors. 

```{r, appendix = TRUE}

str(samples)
summary(samples)

str(results2)
summary(results2)

str(counts[1:5])
summary(counts[1:5])

```


<div class="success">

## Visualizing data with ggplot2

`ggplot2` is a very popular package for making visualization. It is built on the "grammar of graphics". Any plot can be expressed from the same set of components: a data set, a coordinate system, and a set of "geoms" or the visual representation of data points such as points, bars, line, or boxes. This is the template we build on:


```
ggplot(data = <DATA>, aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
  <geom_function>() +
  ...
```



We just used the `count()` function to calculate how many samples are in each group. The function for creating bar graphs (`geom_bar()`) also makes use of `stat = "count"` to plot the total number of observations per variable. Let's use ggplot2 to create a visual representation of how many samples there are per tissue, sex, and hardiness.


```{r bar1, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(samples, aes(x = SMTS)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count")

```

In the last section, we will discuss how to modify the `themes()` to adjust the axes, legends, and more. For now, let's flip the x and y coordinates so that we can read the sample names. We do this by adding a layer and the function `coord_flip()`

```{r bar2, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(samples, aes(x = SMTS)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  coord_flip()

```

Now, there are two ways we can visualize another variable in addition to tissue. We can add color or we can add facets.


Let's first color the data by age bracket. Color is an aesthetic, so it must go inside the `aes()`. If you include `aes(color = AGE)` inside `ggplot()`, the color will be applied to every layer in your plot. If you add `aes(color = AGE)` inside `geom_bar()`, it will only be applied to that layer (which is important later when you layer multiple geoms. 

head(samples)

```{r bar3, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(samples, aes(x = SMTS, color = AGE)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  coord_flip()

```

Note that the bars are outlined in a color according to hardy scale. If instead, you would the bars "filled" with color, use the aesthetic `aes(fill = AGE)`

```{r bar4, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(samples, aes(x = SMTS, fill = AGE)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  coord_flip()

```

Now, let's use `facet_wrap(~SEX)` to break the data into two groups based on the variable sex.

```{r bar5, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(samples, aes(x = SMTS, fill = AGE)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~SEX)

```
With this graph, we have an excellent overview of the total numbers of RNA-Seq samples in the GTEx project, and we can see where we are missing data (for good biological reasons). However, this plot doesn't show us Hardy Scale. It's hard to layer 4 variables, so let's remove Tissue as a variable by focusing just on one Tissue.


<div class="warning">

#### Challenge

Create a plot showing the total number of samples per Sex, Age Bracket, and Hardy Scale for _just_ the Heart samples. Paste the code you used in the chat. 

<div class="spoiler">

There are many options. Here are a few.

  ggplot(colData, aes(x = DTHHRDY, fill = AGE))  +
      geom_bar(stat = "count") +
      facet_wrap(~SEX) 
    
  ggplot(colData, aes(x = AGE, fill = as.factor(DTHHRDY)))  +
      geom_bar(stat = "count") +
      facet_wrap(~SEX) 
    
</div>

One thing these plots show us is that we don't have enough samples to test the effects of all our experimental variables (age, sex, tissue, and hardy scale) and their interactions on gene expression. We can, however, focus on one or two variables or groups at a time. 


Earlier, we imported the file "data/GTEx_Heart_20-29_vs_70-79.tsv")" and saved it as "results".  This file contains the results of a differential gene expression analysis comparing heart tissue from 20-29 to heart tissue from 30-39 year olds. This is a one-way design investigating only the effect of age (but not sex or hardy scale) on gene expression in the heart.  Let's visualize these results.

[Volcano Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_plot_(statistics)) are a type of scatter plots that show the log fold change (logFC) on the x axis and the inverse log (`-log10()`) of a  p-value that has been corrected for multiple hypothesis testing (adj.P.Val). Let's create a Volcano Plot using the `gplot()` and `geom_point()`. _Note: this may take a minute because there are 15,000 points that must be plotted_

```{r, volcano1, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(results, aes(x = logFC, y = -log10(adj.P.Val))) +
  geom_point() 

```

The inverse log of p < 05 is `r -log10(0.05)`. We can add a horizontal line to our plot using `geom_hline()` so that we can visually see how many genes or points are significant and how many are not. 

```{r, volcano2, appendix = TRUE}

ggplot(results, aes(x = logFC, y = -log10(adj.P.Val))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05))

```



<div class="warning">

#### Challenge

Create a volcano plot for the results comparing the heart tissue of 20-29 year olds to that of 70-70 year olds? Are there more or less differential expressed gene between 20 and 30 year olds or 20 and 70 year olds?

<div class="spoiler">

  df <- read.table("./data/GTEx_Heart_20-29_vs_70-79.tsv")

  ggplot(df, aes(x = logFC, y = -log10(adj.P.Val))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05))
  
  # more  

</div>

In addition to containing information about the donor tissue, the "colData" file contains has a column with a RIN score, which tells us about the quality of the data. If we wanted to look for interactions between RIN score and the other variables. 

```{r boxplot, appendix = TRUE}

  ggplot(colData, aes(x = DTHHRDY, y = SMRIN)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = SMRIN))

```


Now you know a handful of R functions for importing, summarizing, and visualizing data. In the next section, we will tidy and transform our data so that we can make even better summaries and figures. In the last section, you will learn ggplot function for making fancier figures.

## Tidy and Transform Data

[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) is the process of tidying and transforming data to make it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. The goal of data wrangling is to assure quality and useful data. Data analysts typically spend the majority of their time in the process of data wrangling compared to the actual analysis of the data.

**Tidying** your data means storing it in a consistent form. When your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions. Some tidying functions include `pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()`, `separate()`, `unite()`, `drop_na()`, `replace_na()`. The "lubridate" package has a number of functions for tidying dates. You may also use `mutate()` function to convert objects from, say, characters or integers to factors or rename observations and variables.


**Transforming** your data includes narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means). Summary functions such as `summarize()` and `count()` to create new tables with statistics. Before summarizing or counting a whole data frame, you can use `group_by()`  to group variables.  You can use `filter()` and `select()` to isolate specific rows or columns, respectively. If you want to sort columns, `arrange()` and `arrange(desc())` are two functions to familiarize yourself with.

**Combining tables** can be accomplished in one of two ways. If all the columns or  all the rows have all the same names, you can use `rbind()` or `cbind()`, respectively, to join the data frames. If however, each data frame have a column (or multiple columns) that contain unique identifiers, then you can use the family of join functions (`inner_join()`, `outter_join()`, `left_join()`, and `right_join()`)


For each downstream analysis, you will likely use a series of tidying and transforming steps in various order to get your data in the appropriate format. Interest of creating dozens of intermediate files after each step, we will use the `%>%` operator to "pipe" the output of one function to the input of the other. 

Instead of going into each function or each process in detail in isolation, let's start with some typical research questions and then piece together R functions to get the desired information

### Question 1: What are the gene names and Ensemble IDs of the top 20 most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the heart tissue between 20-29 and 30-29 year olds?**

To answer this question, we need a subset of information from both the results and genes files.  We need, in no particular order, to:
1. create a column in results with the gene symbols named "Approved.symbol"
1. filter the results for genes adj.p.value  < 0.05 (or desired alpha) and logFC > 1 or <-1
1. arrange the results by descending adj.p.value
1. join the results and genes data frames  by "Approved.symbol"
1. select the gene symbol, name, and ensemble id, lfc, and adj.p.val
1. create lists of ensemble ideas and gene symbols of DEGs

Let's go deeper into each step. 

#### 1.1 Create (mutate) or rename a column in results with the gene symbols named "Approved.symbol"

Currently, we have "results" with gene symbols as the row names and "results2" has a column called "X" with the gene symbol. Depending on which data frame we use, e can either use mutate to create a new column with the name "Approved.symbol", or we can rename column X.


```{r wrangle11a, appendix = TRUE, echo = T, eval = F}

results %>% mutate(Approved.symbol = row.names(.))  

```

```{r wrangle11b, appendix = FALSE, echo = F, eval = T}

results %>% mutate(Approved.symbol = row.names(.)) %>% as_tibble()

```


#### 1.2 Filter the results for genes adj.p.value  < 0.05 (or desired alpha)

Filter is done in a few different ways depending on the type of variable. You can use `>` and less `<` to filter greater or less than a number. `==` and `!=` are used to filter by characters or factors that match or do not match a specific pattern. `%in% c()` is used to filter by things in a list. Let's filter by adjusted p-value. You can use `|` and `&` to mean "or" or "and"


```{r wrangle12, appendix = TRUE}

results %>% filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05,
                   logFC > 1 | logFC < -1)

```


#### 1.3 Arrange the results by adj.p.value, from smallest to largest

We can use the arrange function to reorder observations.



```{r wrangle13a, appendix = TRUE, echo = T, eval = F}

results %>% arrange(adj.P.Val) 

```


```{r wrangle13b, appendix = F, echo = F, eval = T}

results %>% arrange(adj.P.Val) %>% head()

```


Let's combine the three previous steps into one series of commands and save the this as a temporary file that we will join with. 




```{r wrangle13c, appendix = TRUE, echo = F, eval = T}

resultsDEGs <- results %>% 
  mutate(Approved.symbol = row.names(.))  %>% 
  filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05,
         logFC > 1 | logFC < -1) %>%
  arrange(adj.P.Val) 
resultsDEGs

```

#### 1.4 Join the results and genes data frames  by "Approved.symbol"

I find it helpful to import a table of gene names and symbols that can be merged with other tables with gene information or searched for useful information. This table of gene names was downloaded from <https://www.genenames.org/download/custom/>. 

In this case, we use `fill = T` to fill missing fields with a NULL value.

```{r import-3, appendix = TRUE}

genes <- read.table("./data/genes.txt", sep = "\t",  header = T, fill = T)
head(genes)

```


```{r wrangle14, appendix = TRUE, echo = T, eval = F}

left_join(resultsDEGs, genes, by =  "Approved.symbol")

```

```{r wrangle14b, appendix = F, eval = T, echo = F}

left_join(resultsDEGs, genes, by =  "Approved.symbol") %>% as_tibble()

```


#### 1.5 Select the gene symbol, name, and ensemble id, lfc, and adj.p.val

By now, our results file is getting quite wide. We can use the `select()` function to subset data frames by specific column names.


```{r wrangle15, appendix = TRUE}

resultsDEGs %>% select(Approved.symbol, logFC, adj.P.Val)

```



Now, let's combine all five steps into one. However, instead of rearranging by p-value, let's arrange by gene symbol. Let's also convert this object to a tibble with `as_tibble()` for easier viewing. 


```{r wrangle15b, appendix = TRUE}

resultsDEGs <- results %>% 
  mutate(Approved.symbol = row.names(.))  %>% 
  filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05,
         logFC > 1 | logFC < -1) %>% 
  arrange(Approved.symbol) %>%
  left_join(., genes, by =  "Approved.symbol") %>% 
  select(Approved.symbol, Ensembl.gene.ID, logFC, adj.P.Val, Approved.name ) %>%
  as_tibble()
resultsDEGs

```

#### Challenge

Replace the input results file with a different file, such as the results of the comparison of 20-29 and 30-39 year old muscle samples. What are the deferentially expressed genes?

<div class="spoiler">

  resultsDEGs <- results %>% 
  mutate(Approved.symbol = row.names(.))  %>% 
  filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05,
         logFC > 1 | logFC < -1) %>% 
  arrange(Approved.symbol) %>%
  left_join(., genes, by =  "Approved.symbol") %>% 
  select(Approved.symbol, Ensembl.gene.ID, logFC, adj.P.Val, Approved.name ) %>%
  filter(grepl("ENSG", Ensembl.gene.ID)) %>%
  as_tibble()
resultsDEGs

</div>


```{r resultDEGs, appendix = TRUE}
resultsDEGs <- results %>% 
  mutate(Approved.symbol = row.names(.))  %>% 
  filter(adj.P.Val < 0.05,
         logFC > 1 | logFC < -1) %>% 
  arrange(Approved.symbol) %>%
  left_join(., genes, by =  "Approved.symbol") %>% 
  select(Approved.symbol, Ensembl.gene.ID, logFC, adj.P.Val, Approved.name ) %>%
  filter(grepl("ENSG", Ensembl.gene.ID)) %>%
  as_tibble()
resultsDEGs
```



With this exercise, you have explored a few functions related to tidying and transforming data. Let's try one more exercise 

#### 1.6 Create lists of ensemble ids and gene names of DEGs

```{r, DEGlists, appendix = TRUE}
DEGsENSG <- resultsDEGs %>% pull(Ensembl.gene.ID)
DEGsENSG
DEGsSymbol <- resultsDEGs %>% pull(Approved.symbol)
DEGsSymbol
```






### Question 2: What are the raw counts of the differentially expressed genes?

Most RNA-Seq pipelines require that the counts file to be in a matrix format where each sample is a column and each gene is a row and all the values are integers or doubles with all the experimental factors in a separate file. However, many R tools prefer to have these data combined in a single, tidy data frame or tibble. To process the counts data using the DESeq2 pipeline, we need a corresponding file where the row names are the sample id and they match the column names of the counts file. We confirm this by asking if `rownames(colData) == colnames(counts)` or by checking the dimensions of each. Using  `head()` is a good way to only print 5 rows. Using `[1:5]` is a good way to only print 5 columns.

I also like to create  `counts_tidy_long` file that can be easily subset by variables or genes of interest. To create this, we need to combine three data frames: genes, colData (or Samples), and counts. 

In this section, we will combine tidying, transforming, and visualizing to answer the question "What are the raw counts of the deferentially expressed genes?"


```{r question2a, appendix = TRUE}

head(rownames(colData) == colnames(counts))
head(colnames(counts))
head(rownames(colData))

```

```{r question2b, appendix = TRUE}

colData_tidy <-  colData %>%
  mutate(SAMPID = gsub("-", ".", SAMPID))  %>%
  filter(AGE %in% c("20-29", "70-79")) 
rownames(colData_tidy) <- colData_tidy$SAMPID

mycols <- colData_tidy %>% dplyr::pull(SAMPID)

counts_tidy <- counts %>%
  select(mycols)

head(rownames(colData_tidy) == colnames(counts_tidy))

```


```{r question2c, appendix = TRUE}

counts_tidy_long <- counts %>%
  select(all_of(mycols)) %>%
  mutate(Ensembl.gene.ID = rownames(.)) %>%
  separate(Ensembl.gene.ID, into = c("Ensembl.gene.ID", "version"), 
           sep = "\\.") %>%
  filter(Ensembl.gene.ID %in% all_of(DEGsENSG)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = all_of(mycols), names_to = "SAMPID", 
               values_to = "counts") %>%
  inner_join(., colData_tidy, by = "SAMPID") %>%
  arrange(desc(counts)) %>%
  inner_join(., genes, by = "Ensembl.gene.ID") %>%
  select(Ensembl.gene.ID, Approved.name, Approved.symbol, counts, 
         SAMPID, SMTSD, AGE, SEX, DTHHRDY)
head(counts_tidy_long)

```

```{r boxplot2, appendix = TRUE}
library(scales)

counts_tidy_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = AGE, y = counts)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Approved.symbol, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_log10(labels = label_number_si())

```
